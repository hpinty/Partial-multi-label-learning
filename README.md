# Partial Multi-label Feature Selection via Subspace Optimization

This repository is dedicated to the research article titled "Partial Multi-label Feature Selection via Subspace Optimization" which presents a novel feature selection method named PML-FSSO. PML-FSSO utilizes the theory of linear weighted to jointly consider the label subspace and feature subspace, aiming to improve the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in the field of partial multi-label learning.

## Key Features

- **Subspace Optimization**: The method optimizes the feature weights by integrating outcomes from both global and local perspectives.
- **Graph Regularization**: Enhances the model by ensuring consistency between the feature matrix and the coefficient matrix.
- **Extensive Experiments**: Validate the effectiveness of PML-FSSO against existing methods.
